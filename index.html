      Daisyyyyy 

      HAPPY 22nd BIRTHDAY BBG. I hope you’re day is the bestest and you treat yourself even though you have school (👎🏼) I miss my adventure buddy and party girl soooo much.  You were always my go to buddy if I was every feeling spontaneous or needed to let some energy out whether it be through dancing at a party or our yoga and werq classes and I will always cherish these memories. You are someone I can always count on whether it be for a good laugh or I need someone to spill tea to, you’re always there to listen. I hope your bday is as amazing as you are bc you deserve it all bb💖. I can’t wait for our next adventure whenever that may be and I hope you are thriving in your big adult masters program at UNC (I will be visiting at some point for sure and we will do picklebacks together). Love you bbg and happy birthday!!!!!!!!!🎉🎂🎈🎁
      
      Loves ya,

      Hey Daisy, happy birthday! I hope you’re doing well and getting accustomed to grad school life. I figure things may be hectic rn as you settle into UNC, so I wish your birthday will be as fun-filled and stress-free as can be. Keep on pursuing what you want, and best of luck with school(and everything!).

Happy Birthday again, 🍾🎊🎉

      Happy Birthday Daisy!! I’m so proud of you for everything you have achieved and now crushing grad school. You are the most supportive and kind hearted person and you never fail to make me laugh till I cry. If you ever need anything I’m only one call, text, or 4 hour drive away. Starting this semester without you has been so surreal without you here to make my day with your smile or murder my tastebuds with spicy food. I can’t wait to come visit you so you can show me your bartending skills. I will even let you take me around town even though we’ll both definitely get lost. Keep being your incredible impeccable self forever and have a fucking blast. Love you so much ❤️❤️❤️

      Daisy my girl~😍😚🎊 Happy happy bday:))) Wow actually can’t believe we’re so old already hahaa. I know it’s been a while since we’ve had deep convos or a hangout, but I always appreciate having you in my life. You’re such a bright and loving presence wherever you are, and I’m so grateful that you still help me feel comfortable and safe in our friendship. Thanks so much for always reaching out and showing me love, and I hope you know that I’m also here for you in the same way whenever you need. Let me know if you ever come to NY pleaseee:) let’s have some good old freshmen-energy-fun you cute and sexy bean (we’re still young and slaying haha).

      HELLO DAISY my role model sexy blaez crocheting foodie influencer queen!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY wow u lovely human I can’t believe that ur turning 22 NOW what a magical year 🥹 Reflecting back on our cs education I can’t tell whether us doing the major together was beneficial or ultimately detrimental to our overall productivity but I WUD NOT TRADE IT FOR THE WORLD. Daisy I love and miss all the moments and people we memed from mackadil to la fleur, the TEA that was shared abt dphie and the magician, satisfying our food cravings and multiple outings to okiboru, and just being a nuisance to everyone from building blocks to 350. IM JUST SAD WE DIDNT GET TO HANG OUT MORE but I know 44falling will be reunited again soon 😢 we might be far away rn but I will always be ur biggest fan!! I believe in u, I’m cheering for you, and I love you so much. ❤️❤️

Dear Daisy Kim,

HAPPY MF BIRTHDAY!! It’s only been months since we all parted our ways post-college, but I miss you a lot, and even though we’re so far apart and separated— our golden era has only just begun. It’s still crazy how close we grew in a short amount of time… You are so funny and cool and hot and resilient and strong and big brained and ____. Truly creating the best energy everywhere you go. I am excited to f*ck around in a dance studio one day with *the* badass DANCE and CHOREOGRAPHY QUEEN— I still regret not volunteering for the BlaeZ showcase audience part. 

I hope that your birthday was filled with delicious food, booze, and sleep. I hope that people are treating you well and respecting you, and if not I will find them and step on them all!

WE WILL *CONTINUE* OUR ADVENTURES AND CROSS PATHS AGAIN & AGAIN & AGAIN (unless you don’t want to then we respect that :’) ).

Much love.

Sincerely,
Randy Truong
